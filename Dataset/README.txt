The dataset we use for modeling is artificial data regarding user reviews and problems (sourced from the internet) that often occur when going to do home reconstruction or repair (by calling an expert or handyman). The file 'text.csv' is the original collection of review sentences of user problems.

There is additional synthetic data adjusted from 15-20 direct survey data with daily workers, which is then used as the basis for data generalization through data synthesis building techniques. The file 'synthetic_handyman.csv' is the result of data generalization.


Here are the details of the original data stored:
