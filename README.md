### JuKang ID Model Machine Learning

We built a model for recommendation based on the search for frequently occurring problems related to building reconstruction. 

The model has several responsibilities and stages such as:
1. Load and Preprocessing data
2. Building Text Classification with RNN (LSTM)
3. Testing and evaluating the model with evaluation metrics
4. Saving the model result
5. Convert the model into tensorflow.js for deployment purposes (optional)

Tools and Resources for Developing a Model

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook and Google Collaboration
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikitlearn, Tensorflow, Keras, NLTK, Sastrawi, Matplotlib, Seaborn

How To Run The Model
- Clone this repository: git clone `https://github.com/Jukang-ID/jukang-id-ml.git`
- Navigate to the project directory
